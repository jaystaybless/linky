			<p>I love to browse the web. I also love to use different devices. Whilst using different devices on a daily bases I face one major problem and I bet you do to. When moving from one device to another, I am unable to keep track of my bookmarks as they are all saved within the browser I am using.</p>
			<br>
			<p>To put an end to all my troubles I created this app, which will allow me me to create an archive of all the websites I wish to return to at a later date.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This app is simple and effective. It allows users to create Categories, Sub Categories and Links.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Keep your eyes on this baby as there will be a lot more functionality to come as it grows into a mature adult.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Please feel free to download. Don't hesitate to make any suggestions for future modifications / features.</p>
